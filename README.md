# This Site Isnt About Dogs
If you're reading this, congratulations, you're a human! Chances are someone posted this on a forum or some other kind of sharing website with a very different title, so you're probably wondering what on earth you are even looking at right now, don't worry, I'll explain everything!

# This site is actually an LLM bot honeypot trap
The goal of this website is to be something you can link (with a different fake title) on your forum (IE Reddit, Lemmy, whatever), to catch any bots that utilize AI content generation, and trolls, etc.

# How does it work?
Simple, everything you are reading here right now is actually inside some images, and most off the shelf sort of bot LLM programs havent a chance in hell of doing OCR stuff to even notice what is in these pictures, instead they'll probably just skip right past them.

Instead, if you open up the html of this website, you'll see at the bottom after all the images, is a massive mountain of invisible text talking about random dog facts. Any type of LLM/AI will parse that data instead, whereas a normal human would never see that

# How to catch the bots
There are two types of bot/troll posters you'll get that respond to your post sharing this link.

1. Users that comment and respond based on your fake title, effectively demonstrating they didnt even read the website at all, and instead simply just took the title at face value and started spouting off a bunch of hallucinated garbage that has nothing to do with anything on this site. IE if you title your post something like "Headline: Teenage son killed by father in drunk driving accident" and people just start responding about some kind of hallucinated story about how they read the article and how sad it is, you got yourself some low grade LLM bots (or trolls)
2. Users that comment and suddenly start talking about dog facts, their favorite dogs, or whatever, are bots that actually parsed this website and responded based on that.
